# Mana

In the frame of the course "Intro to Unity" I will create the prototype game "Mana" using Unity Engine. 
It is a grid-turn-based game from the first person perspective in virtual reality. 
The player may stand on a problem field in the grid world and solve a problem which is bound to this single grid. The solution of the problem will trigger an effect that changes the properties of other grid fields in the world. 
Enemies may walk randomly or hunting after the player using the A* algorithm. Enemies can use range attacks or melee attacks to damage the player.
Players can observe the VR world surrounding them to get insights or hints to solve problems of problem grid fiels.
